# Week  7: Object oriented programming

**Resources**

[Think Python](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it211/documents/think-python-2nd.pdf) is a great book about Python programming, from which I have cropped the following chapters for this week

* [Classes and Objects](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week7/Resources/Classes%20and%20Objects.pdf)
* [Classes and Functions](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week7/Resources/Classes%20and%20Functions.pdf)
* [Classes and Methods](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week7/Resources/Classes%20and%20Methods.pdf)
* [Inheritance](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week7/Resources/Inheritance.pdf)
* [The Goodies](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week7/Resources/The%20Goodies.pdf)

These are video lectures and slides from MIT course about programming in Python, which are really great
