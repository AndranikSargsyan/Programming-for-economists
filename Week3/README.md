# Week 3: Lists and Functions 

**Resources**

[Think Python](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it211/documents/think-python-2nd.pdf) is a great book about Python programming, from which I have cropped the following chapters for this week
* [Lists](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week3/Resources/Lists.pdf)
* [Functions](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week3/Resources/Functions.pdf)

These are video lectures and slides from MIT course about programming in Python, which are really great
* Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, and Cloning [[video](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-5-tuples-lists-aliasing-mutability-and-cloning)] [[slides](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-slides-code/MIT6_0001F16_Lec5.pdf)]
* Decomposition, Abstraction, and Functions [[video](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-4-decomposition-abstraction-and-functions)] [[slides](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-slides-code/MIT6_0001F16_Lec4.pdf)]
