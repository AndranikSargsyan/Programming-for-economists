# Week 2: Basic objects and control structures 

**Resources**

[Think Python](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it211/documents/think-python-2nd.pdf) is a great book about Python programming, from which I have cropped the following chapters for this week
* [The Way of the Program]()
* [Variables, Expressions and Statements]()
* [Conditionals]()
* [Iteration]()

These are video lectures and slides from MIT course about programming in Python, which are really great
* What is computation?
