# Week 2: Basic objects and control structures 

**Resources**

[Think Python](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it211/documents/think-python-2nd.pdf) is a great book about Python programming, from which I have cropped the following chapters for this week
* [The Way of the Program](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week2/Resources/The%20Way%20of%20the%20Program.pdf)
* [Variables, Expressions and Statements](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week2/Resources/Variables%2C%20Expressions%20and%20Statements.pdf)
* [Conditionals](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week2/Resources/Conditionals.pdf)
* [Iteration](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week2/Resources/Iteration.pdf)

These are video lectures and slides from MIT course about programming in Python, which are really great
* What is computation?

* Branching and Iteration [[video](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-2-branching-and-iteration)][[slides](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-slides-code/MIT6_0001F16_Lec2.pdf)]
