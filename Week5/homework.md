## Problem 1: Factorial

Write a function which takes an integer as an argument and **recursively** generates and returns the factorial of that number. Program should ask for a natural number from the user, calculate it's factorial using written funtion and print the result. Program should ask the user for a new input and print it's factorial unless user types "exit". Use caching to speed up computations.
