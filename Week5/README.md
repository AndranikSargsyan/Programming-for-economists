# Week 5: Recursion, Dictionaries, Sets, Algorithmic complexity

**Resources**

[Think Python](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it211/documents/think-python-2nd.pdf) is a great book about Python programming, from which I have cropped the following chapters for this week

* [Recursion](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week5/Resources/Recursion.pdf)
* [Dictionaries](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week5/Resources/Dictionaries.pdf)
* [Sets](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week5/Resources/Sets.pdf)
* [Analysis of algorithms](https://github.com/AndranikSargsyan/Programming-for-economists/blob/master/Week5/Resources/Analysis%20of%20Algorithms.pdf)

These are video lectures and slides from MIT course about programming in Python, which are really great

* Recursion and Dictionaries [[video](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-videos/lecture-6-recursion-and-dictionaries/)] [[slides](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/lecture-slides-code/MIT6_0001F16_Lec6.pdf)]
